Question: how to solve question 3).
when you have two models you can calculate the AIC or the BIC. these two are information criteria.
this means this two models will be similar in this criteria.

the criteria is a value AIC = -2logL -> The lower the better. residual variance
a lower value of this it implies a better model but if oyu are adding variables, it might be a more complicated model
to avoid so, you try to penalize it with a K. this is a straight line so that you find an optimum and therefore,
there is a best model. for instance k=2 (default of the step method) 
if you use this approach you might find p values higher than 5% so it means that are not significant and must be dropped.

to avoid this problem he suggests to add this weight: BIC with k=log(N) where N is the number of the observation. 
By using the BIC with this weight it will give us a lower model with less variables bc is more exigent.

But remember that sometimes by using this approach (the latter ) you still have some non-significant values. this is because there is
some interaction in the model that makes that even it doesnt appear directly it is still affecting (not sure about this last phrase).

Question: how many models we have to create?
there are two ways:
  1- step(mo, scope = list(upper=mt), direct=BOTH, k=logN) this goes from simpliest to most complicated.
  2- step(mt, dir= , k=) this goes from the most complicated and tries to simplify

usually both give a diff result. we could compare both, both are heuristics.
